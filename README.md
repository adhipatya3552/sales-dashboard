* **Filter Controls**: Hook the filter and calendar icons to open dropdowns or date pickers. Integrate with React state or third-party picker libraries.
* **Styling**: Modify Tailwind classes in `index.css` or extend `tailwind.config.js` for custom themes.
* **Additional Metrics**: Add more `StatCard` components or chart types (PieChart, ComposedChart) from Recharts as needed.
* **Routing**: If adding more pages, integrate React Router and create separate components under `src/pages/`.
